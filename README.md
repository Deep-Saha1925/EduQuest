## 🎯 New Features

### Subject Cards on Home Page
Students now see beautiful, interactive cards for each subject category on the home page. Each card includes:

- Category-specific icons (Networking, Java, Python, Database, Web Development)
- Color-coded design for easy identification
- Hover effects with smooth animations
- Direct links to start a quiz in that subject

### Category Selection Flow
1. **Home Page (`/`)** - Displays all available subjects as cards
2. **Category Selection (`/quiz/category/{category}`)** - Shows quiz configuration options
3. **Quiz Questions (`/quiz/question`)** - Category-specific questions
4. **Results Page (`/quiz/result`)** - Shows category badge and detailed results

## 📊 How It Works

### Category Detection
- Automatically detects all unique categories from the `questions` table
- Auto-discovered from existing questions
- Sorted alphabetically
- Filters out null/empty values

### Question Selection
- System fetches all questions from the selected category
- Randomly selects the specified number of questions
- Presents questions one by one
- Tracks the category throughout the session

### Database Query Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM questions 
WHERE category = 'Java' 
ORDER BY RAND() 
LIMIT 10;
